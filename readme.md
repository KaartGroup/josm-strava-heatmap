# JOSM Strava Heatmap

This browser extension adds a button to the [Strava Global Heatmap][1] that
copies the TMS imagery url for use in the [Java OpenStreetMap Editor][2] (JOSM).

Accessing this imagery externally requires a set of key parameters that you obtain
by signing into the Strava website, copying the values from several cookies, and
then assembling into a query string at the end of the url.  The keys expire after a
week or so at which point you must repeat the process.  This extension builds the
url for you which makes this weekly process a bit less annoying.

Available as a [Firefox Add-On][4] or [Chrome extension][7].  The Chrome extension
should also work in Microsoft Edge and other Chromium based browsers.

## Instructions

1. Visit [strava.com/heatmap][5] and log in â€“ sign up for a free account if you don't have one
2. *Optional* - Select the heatmap color and activity type you want to use
3. Click the button pictured below to copy the TMS imagery url prepopulated with the required
   `Key-Pair-Id`, `Policy`, and `Signature` parameters
4. Paste the copied url into a custom imagery layer in JOSM or iD (remove the `tms:` prefix
   for iD - see editor specific sections below)

### Using the imagery in JOSM

Add a new TMS layer in the [JOSM imagery preferences][6].  Name it Strava Heatmap and paste in the
copied url.  If you are updating an expired Strava Heatmap layer you can just double-click it to
replace url in the list view.

### Using the imagery in iD

Open the Backgrounds panel and select "Custom" at the bottom.  Paste the copied url into the
Custom Background Settings window that opens.  Remove the `tms:` prefix at the beginning of
the url so it just starts with `https://heatmap-external- ...`.  This prefix is necessary for
JOSM but must be removed for iD.
